# Simple Chat App using Python
This is a simple chat application using python. This project utilizes socket programming and threading. A server is set up, allowing multiple clients to establish a connection to a server and the server broadcast the messages that clients send to each other.

This project also has an logging and command-execution features. Clients can run specific commands such as number of online users or clearing the chat. And, All the messages ,that are sent by clients, are logged by the server in a server.log file.
